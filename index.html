        <p id="about">Hi there, welcome to my <em>About Me</em> page. I am a 23 year old junior software developer. I am a Taurus that was born in Tacoma, WA. From there I moved to the East Coast, having lived in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania before moving back to Washington state. I attended the University of Washington and graduated in 2020 with my BA in Communications with a minor in Informatics. I was a member of the Sigma Kappa sorority at the UW and held a position called Design Specialist where I handled PR and marketing for our chapter. I also had previosly worked at Microsoft in their retail stores as a Product Advisor.  My dream job is to be a developer for Walt Disney; growing up I wanted to be an animator, but learned that Walt Disney Animations and Pixar use developers to develop softwares to aid their animators. These programs are usually build to help simulate some aspect of real life to help with their story telling.

        <p id="animals"> Some fun little facts about myself are that I love all animals. I want to own a lot of animals one day ranging from dogs, and cats, to lizards, and horses. I currently am a pet mom to two cats. A black cat named Midna and a grey cat named Kiara. I hope to be adding a boa constrictor to my family soon! I am extremely passionate about animal welfare and want to be able to create a web application one day dedicated toward helping animals out. Specifically, helping match potential new owners with pets that need adoption. There are so many dogs and cats alike that are being rehomed each year and end up in shelters.
