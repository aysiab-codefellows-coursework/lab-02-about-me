## About Me Guessing Game
I build a basic web application that takes an input from a user for their name, before alerting them of a guessing game. 5 prompts appear asking for a "yes/no" or "y/n" input for the user to guess information about me. An alert appears after each prompt alerting the user of whether they are correct or not. A final alert thanks the user for playing, and then my page loads with paragraphs about myself and a link to my cats' instagram.

### Comments & Reflections:
- I have dabbled in introductory JavaScript before and am familair with functions in other languages such as Java and Python. I figured that making a function to handle checking responses for the guessing game would lead to less code redundancy.
